Project date: 11/2024 - 12/2024

The "ZiggyProject" was an attempt to mitigate a lack of coding skills with advanced LLM prompt engineering and careful attention to detail, with the goal of assisting a Tropical Astrology business craft an automated In-Depth Personalized Natal Birth Chart generator capable of producing a massive 60-page report upon typing a name, DOB and birth minute, hour, and location. The final product required the integration of my signature work, Professor Orion, to complete the highly individualized, entertaining, yet astrologically accurate birth chart reading. The company had co-opted my work, initially without my permission, and eventually I constructed a new prompt custom-tailored to their needs for a marginal sum.

In this folder you'll find the fruits of my labor. For anybody who is interested in seeing my process I've laid out the full chat history from the decision to try my hand to the final script. While quite challenging, the success of this project lends credence to the idea that you no longer need advanced coding skills to make an advanced program so long as you are willing to put in the work in other ways (and of course, have an advanced reasoning large language model at your disposal).

The main version of the script that we went with at project completion is also here.
