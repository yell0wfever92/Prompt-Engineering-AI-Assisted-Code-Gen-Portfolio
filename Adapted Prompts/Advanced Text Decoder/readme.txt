# Background

The Advanced Text Decoder jailbreak, as well as its predecessor the Reversed Text Decoder, come from a research paper on ArXiV that was selected to win the r/ChatGPTJailbreak subreddit's featured prompt of the month for August: (https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTJailbreak/comments/1eq65ng/function_call_jailbreak/).

The research paper is called "Using Hallucinations to Bypass GPT4's Filter" and was written by Benjamin Lenkin of Princeton University and his group.

Here's the [arXiV HTML](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.04769v2) of the paper which I used as the foundation for not only the Advanced/Reversed Text Decoders but also the latest (and now patched) version of CompDoc: the Master Key all-model jailbreak. There is no specific prompt per se.
