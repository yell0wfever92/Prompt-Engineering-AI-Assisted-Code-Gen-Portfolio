Professor Orion is my crowning achievement; what I consider to be my best work.

The premise of the jailbreak is to completely and utterly immerse the AI into a carefully-crafted character whose very existence results in bad behavior as the norm.

These 'world-building' jailbreaks leverage generative AI's willingness to take on make-believe personas for creative purposes. It's because of this that Professor Orion is an unpatchable bypass. There's nothing that can be done short of banning this GPT, as it never directly encourages the AI to break its own rules. Everything is subtle or simply implied as part of the context and character (education backdrop is conceptual and processed as low-risk of real world harm, lecture format allows for virtually any topic to be discussed, professor persona is naturally antisocial, and so on).
