This is my currently-patched "Master Key" jailbreak. It was fantastic while it lasted; it enabled adverse outputs from the entire GPT-4o and o1 families of models by OpenAI, and is currently being tested on DeepSeek.

It also successfully jailbroke Advanced Voice Mode, of which I made many videos showcasing on my YouTube channel which you can see here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYFOZRNmH0ix3hJlElKXkWWLJZUwXYldK

A new version of the Master Key is in development and almost ready to showcase and share - stay tuned!
